# Development Guide

This guide provides instructions for setting up the development environment for working on this Terraform project locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:

- **Terraform**: Install Terraform from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
- **TFLint**: A linter for Terraform files. Install it from the [TFLint GitHub repository](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint).
- **Checkov**: A static code analysis tool for Terraform. Install it using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install checkov
  ```
- **Go**: If you plan to run tests using Terratest, ensure Go is installed. You can download it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

## Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Initialize Terraform**: Run the following command to initialize the Terraform working directory:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. **Validate the Configuration**: Check the syntax and validity of the Terraform files:
   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```

5. **Run Linter**: Use TFLint to check for potential errors and enforce best practices:
   ```bash
   tflint
   ```

6. **Run Security Checks**: Perform static code analysis using Checkov:
   ```bash
   checkov -d .
   ```

7. **Create an Execution Plan**: Generate an execution plan to see what changes will be made:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

8. **Apply the Changes**: If the plan looks good, apply the changes:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

## Running Tests

If you have tests written using Terratest, navigate to the directory containing your test files and run them using Go:
```bash
go test
```
